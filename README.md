# kikobot
Discord bot to help AnimeFest members and staff

Kiko or more formally Akiko Kumagai, is the mascot of AnimeFest.  The initial focus of this bot is to welcome new server users and automatically assign roles based on their roles on animefest.org.  This is also a learning playground for natural language processing with attempts to give the mascot some personality.

Contributions are welcome.  Just fork the project, make some improvements, and submit a pull request.
